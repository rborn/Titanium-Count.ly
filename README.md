# Count.ly Titanium iOS SDK

Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. It collects data from mobile phones, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data (for iOS & Android).

Countly Server;

- [Countly Server (countly-server)](https://github.com/Countly/countly-server)

Other Countly SDK repositories;

- [Countly Android SDK (countly-sdk-android)](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android)

## Usage

### Start Count.ly

**Start Tracking**
```
var countly = require('count.ly');
countly.start('APP_KEY','http://API_HOST.com');
```

### Record Events

**Set any of the following Fields in an Object**

```
var segmentation = {device:"iPhone 4S", country:"USA"};
var eventData = {name: "keySegmentationCountSum", segmentation:segmentation, count: 1, sum: 0.99};

```

- name (required) : Name of the event to track  
- _(example - Track clicks on the help button "clickedHelp" )_
- count (required) : Number to increment the event in the db
- _(example - User purchases item increment by 1 )_
- sum : If the event is tied to an overall numerical data, such as a purchase, we can use sum to keep track of that
- _(example - 0.99)_
- segmentation : Categorization of the event
- _(example - User is from USA and uses an iPhone 4S so the segmentation will be {device:"iPhone 4S", country:"USA"} )_

**Track Events Examples**

```
var segmentation = {device:"iPhone 4S", country:"USA"};

Ti.API.log("Send keyCount Event");
var eventData = {name: "keyCount", count: 1};
Countly.event(eventData);

Ti.API.log("Send keyCountSum Event");
var eventData = {name: "keyCountSum", count: 1, sum: 0.99};
Countly.event(eventData);

Ti.API.log("Send keySegmentationCount Event");
var eventData = {name: "keySegmentationCount", segmentation:segmentation, count: 1};
Countly.event(eventData);
